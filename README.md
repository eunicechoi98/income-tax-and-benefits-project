# income-tax-and-benefits-project
I have never learned or understood to file my own taxes. I always thought "oh that's so confusing, I'm just gonna get my parents to do it for me". But, really, my parents don't know either, their accountant does. Do YOU know how? WHY do most people have to pay other people to deal with this? WHY couldn't it be easier? So I thought I would create a tool that could help people (me definitely included) when the time comes around for income tax szn!

Steps to filing an income tax & benefit return:
Step 1: Collect all your information and supporting documents that show your income, and that support any deductions and credits you plan to claim

Step 2: Select the software you will use to fill out your return or get the general income tax and benefit package for 2017

Step 3: Make sure your personal information is up to date

Step 4: Report your income
