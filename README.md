# income-tax-and-benefits-project
I have never learned or understood to file my own taxes. I always thought "oh that's so confusing, I'm just gonna get my parents to do it for me". But, really, my parents don't know either, their accountant does. Do YOU know how? WHY do most people have to pay other people to deal with this? WHY couldn't it be easier? 

To start off, some of us save all of our receipts to maximize our tax refund when it comes to income tax szn. Even if you know to save the right ones such as medical expenses, childcare expenses, unreimbursed work-related expenses, self-employed expenses, and more, isn't it just such a bother? I lose my keys to my home daily, I find receipts in the bottom of my backpack all useless all the time. Shouldn't there be a better organization? So I thought I would create a tool that could help people (me definitely included) keeping the receipts we need with much lower commitment and risk to lose them to minimize the amount of paperwork during tax szn!
